# Cash Register Project

This is a Pokémon Search App project created as part of my JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification from FreeCodeCamp. The project allows users to search for Pokémon by name or ID and displays detailed information about the selected Pokémon, including its stats, types, and an image.

## Project Overview

The Pokémon Search App lets users search for any Pokémon by entering its name or ID. Once a search is made, the app retrieves and displays the Pokémon's data, including its stats (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.), types, and a high-resolution image. The design features a Pokémon-themed layout with custom fonts, background images, and responsive styling. The project focuses on client-side JavaScript for fetching and displaying data from the Pokémon API, with enhancements for image handling and CSS-based visuals.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Fetch API for handling asynchronous requests
